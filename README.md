I have 1.2 years of hands-on experience as a DevOps and SRE Engineer, with expertise in AWS DevOps ecosystems. My skill set includes Terraform, Jenkins pipelines, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Shell scripting, and Git.

In AWS, Iâ€™ve worked with services such as EC2, EKS, ECR, VPC, Route 53, Subnets, NAT Gateways, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail to automate infrastructure and improve visibility.

I build and manage Docker images using Dockerfiles, handle container lifecycle operations, and manage volumes. Iâ€™ve deployed workloads to Kubernetes using Helm charts and YAML manifests for real-time scaling and rollouts.

For CI/CD, Iâ€™ve created multi-stage Jenkins pipelines, integrated version control systems, and automated deployments across environments. Iâ€™ve also implemented Git-based branching and merging strategies to streamline collaboration and release workflows.
