✨ About Me
---

I have 1.2 years of hands-on experience as a software engineer, with expertise in AWS DevOps ecosystems. My skill set includes Terraform, Jenkins pipelines, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Shell scripting, and Git.

In AWS, I’ve worked with resources such as EC2, lambda, ECR, EKS, VPC, Route 53, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail to automate infrastructure and improve visibility.

I build and manage Docker images using Dockerfiles, handle container lifecycle operations, and manage volumes. I’ve deployed workloads to Kubernetes using Helm charts and YAML manifests for real-time scaling and rollouts.

For CI/CD, I’ve created multi-stage Jenkins pipelines, integrated version control systems, and automated deployments across environments. I’ve also implemented Git-based branching and merging strategies to streamline collaboration and release workflows.
